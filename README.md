# LCD_Display_ElegooMega2560
Arduino project integrating a 16x2 or 20x4 LCD display with the Elegoo Mega 2560. Supports both I2C and parallel wiring methods
#include <LiquidCrystal.h> // Include the LiquidCrystal library


🛠️ Required Components
	•	Arduino Mega 2560 (or compatible board)
	•	16x2 LCD Display
	•	Potentiometer (10kΩ) - for contrast adjustment
	•	Jumper wires
	•	Breadboard (optional, for easier wiring)

 🔌 Circuit Wiring Guide
	•	Power Connections:
	•	Connect VSS to GND
	•	Connect VDD to 5V
	•	Connect A (LED +) to 5V (for backlight)
	•	Connect K (LED -) to GND
	•	Contrast Adjustment:
	•	Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to V0
	•	Connect one side of the potentiometer to 5V
	•	Connect the other side to GND
	•	Control Pins:
	•	RS → Pin 12
	•	RW → GND (Set to write mode)
	•	E (Enable) → Pin 11
	•	Data Pins:
	•	D4 → Pin 5
	•	D5 → Pin 4
	•	D6 → Pin 3
	•	D7 → Pin 2

🚀 How to Upload to Arduino
	1.	Assemble the circuit following the wiring guide above.
	2.	Open Arduino IDE and make sure the LiquidCrystal library is installed.
	3.	Copy and paste the code into a new sketch.
	4.	Select the correct board and port:
	5.	Go to Tools > Board > Arduino Mega 2560
	6.	Select the correct COM Port under Tools > Port
	7.	Click the Upload button.
 Issues & Fixes
	•	Nothing is displayed on the LCD
	•	Check all connections and ensure power is supplied.
	•	Adjust the potentiometer to control contrast.
	•	Make sure the LCD is initialized correctly in the code.
	•	LCD backlight is off
	•	Ensure A (LED +) is connected to 5V and K (LED -) to GND.
	•	Text is garbled or incorrect
	•	Verify the wiring of RS, E, and data pins (D4-D7).
	•	Ensure the correct board and port are selected before uploading.
	•	Upload fails or serial port is not detected
	•	Check that the USB cable is properly connected.
	•	Restart the Arduino IDE and try again.

 
Happy Coding😊
